This repo holds the code and text behind the **R Packages** book.
The site is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org).

-   The first edition is no longer available online.
-   A second edition is under development and available at <https://r-pkgs.org>.

## Notes on mechanics

[Quarto callouts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html) look like this:

```         
::: callout-tip
Here's a super handy nifty thing!
:::
```

At the time of writing (2022-08-31), we use `callout-tip`, `callout-warning`, `callout-note`, and `callout-important`.
The `XXX` of `callout-XXX` is its type and controls the icon and color:

-   `-tip` green
-   `-warning` orange
-   `-note` blue
-   `-important` red

Use a `##`-level header to caption the callout.

Do this for tips specific to RStudio:

```         
::: callout-tip
## RStudio
Here's a super handy nifty thing about RStudio specifically.
:::
```

The other callout that appears multiple times is:

```         
::: callout-warning
## Submitting to CRAN
Here's something to super careful about.

```
