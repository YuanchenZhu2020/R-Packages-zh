It is about saving yourself time.\" Organising code in a package makes your life easier because packages come with conventions.\nFor example, you put R code in `R/`, you put tests in `tests/` and you put data in `data/`.\nThese conventions are helpful because:\n\n-   They save time --- you don't need to think about the best way to organise a project, you can just follow a template.\n\n-   Standardised conventions lead to standardised tools --- if you buy into R's package conventions, you get many tools for free.\n\nIt's even possible to use packages to structure your data analyses (e.g., @marwick2018-tas or @marwick2018-peerj), although we won't delve deeply into that use case here.\n\n## Philosophy {#sec-intro-phil}\n\nThis book espouses our philosophy of package development: anything that can be automated, should be automated.\nDo as little as possible by hand.\nDo as much as possible with functions.\nThe goal is to spend your time thinking about what you want your package to do rather than thinking about the minutiae of package structure.\n\nThis philosophy is realized primarily through the devtools package, which is the public face for a suite of R functions that automate common development tasks.\nThe release of version 2.0.0 in October 2018 marked its internal restructuring into a set of more focused packages, with devtools becoming more of a meta-package.\nThe usethis package is the sub-package you are most likely to interact with directly; we explain the devtools-usethis relationship in @sec-setup-usage.\n\nAs always, the goal of devtools is to make package development as painless as possible.\nIt encapsulates the best practices developed by Hadley Wickham, initially from his years as a prolific solo developer.\nMore recently, he has assembled a team of developers at Posit (formerly known as RStudio), who collectively look after hundreds of open source R packages, including those known as [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org).\nThe reach of this team allows us to explore the space of all possible mistakes at an extraordinary scale.\nFortunately, it also affords us the opportunity to reflect on both the successes and failures, in the company of expert and sympathetic colleagues.\nWe try to develop practices that make life more enjoyable for both the maintainer and users of a package.\nThe devtools meta-package is where these lessons are made concrete.\n\ndevtools works hand-in-hand with RStudio, which we believe is the best development environment for most R users.\nThe most popular alternative to RStudio is currently [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code) with the [R extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r) enabled.\nThis can be a rewarding and powerful environment, however it does require a bit more work to set up and customize[^introduction-1].\n\n[^introduction-1]: Users of [Emacs Speaks Statistics](https://ess.r-project.org/) (ESS) will find that many of the workflows described in this book are also available there.\n    For those loyal to vim, we recommend the [Nvim-R plugin](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R).\n\n::: callout-tip\n## RStudio\n\nThroughout the book, we highlight specific ways that RStudio can expedite your package development workflow, in specially formatted sections like this.\n:::\n\nTogether, devtools and RStudio insulate you from the low-level details of how packages are built.\nAs you start to develop more packages, we highly recommend that you learn more about those details.\nThe best resource for the official details of package development is always the official [writing R extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Creating-R-packages) manual[^introduction-2].\nHowever, this manual can be hard to understand if you're not already familiar with the basics of packages.\nIt's also exhaustive, covering every possible package component, rather than focusing on the most common and useful components, as this book does.\nWriting R extensions is a useful resource once you've mastered the basics and want to learn what's going on under the hood.\n\n[^introduction-2]: You might also enjoy the \"quarto-ized\" version at [https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-exts/](https://rstudio.github.io/r-manuals/r-exts/Function-and-variable-index.html).\n\n## In this book {#intro-outline}\n\nThe first part of the book is all about giving you all the tools you need to start your package development journey and we highly recommend that you read it in order.\nWe begin in @sec-whole-game with a run through the complete development of a small package.\nIt's meant to paint the big picture and suggest a workflow, before we descend into the detailed treatment of the key components of an R package.\nThen in @sec-setup you'll learn how to prepare your system for package development, and in @sec-package-structure-state you'll learn the basic structure of a package and how that varies across different states.\nNext, in @sec-workflow101, we'll cover the core workflows that come up repeatedly for package developers.\nThe first part of the book ends with another case study (@sec-package-within), this time focusing on how you might convert a script to a package and discussing the challenges you'll face along the way.\n\nThe remainder of the book is designed to be read as needed.\nPick and choose between the chapters as the various topics come up in your development process.\n\nFirst we cover key package components: @sec-r discusses where your code lives and how to organize it, @sec-data shows you how to include data in your package, and @sec-misc covers a few less important files and directories that need to be discussed somewhere.\n\nNext we'll dive into to the package metadata, starting with `DESCRIPTION` in @sec-description.\nWe'll then go deep into dependencies.\nIn @sec-dependencies-mindset-background, we'll cover the costs and benefits of taking on dependencies and provide some technical background on package namespaces and the search path.\nIn @sec-dependencies-in-practice, we focus on practical matters, such as how to use different types of dependencies in different parts of your package.\nThis is also where we discuss exporting functions, which is what makes it possible for other packages and projects to depend on your package.\nWe'll finish off this part with a look at licensing in @sec-license.\n\nTo ensure your package works as designed (and continues to work as you make changes), it's essential to test your code, so the next three chapters cover the art and science of testing.\n@sec-testing-basics gets you started with the basics of testing with the testthat package.\n@sec-testing-design teaches you how to design and organise tests in the most effective way.\nThen we finish off our coverage of testing in @sec-testing-advanced which teaches you advanced skills to tackle challenging situations.\n\nIf you want other people (including future-you!) to understand how to use the functions in your package, you'll need to document them.\n@sec-man gets you started using roxygen2 to document the functions in your package.\nFunction documentation is only helpful if you know what function to look up, so next in @sec-vignettes we'll discuss vignettes, which help you document the package as a whole.\nWe'll finish up documentation with a discussion of other important markdown files like `README.md` and `NEWS.md` in @sec-other-markdown, and creating a package website with pkgdown in @sec-website.\n\nThe book concludes by zooming back out to consider development practices, such as the benefit of using version control and continuous integration (@sec-sw-dev-practices).\nWe wrap things up by discussing the lifecycle (@sec-lifecycle) of a package, including releasing it on CRAN (@sec-release).\n\nThis is a lot to learn, but don't feel overwhelmed.\nStart with a minimal subset of useful features (e.g. just an `R/` directory!) and build up over time.\nTo paraphrase the Zen monk Shunryu Suzuki: \"Each package is perfect the way it is --- and it can use a little improvement\".\n\n## What's not here\n\nThere are also specific practices that have little to no treatment here simply because we do not use them enough to have any special insight.\nDoes this mean that we actively discourage those practices?\nProbably not, as we try to be explicit about practices we think you should avoid.\nSo if something is not covered here, it just means that a couple hundred heavily-used R packages are built without meaningful reliance on that technique.\nThat observation should motivate you to evaluate how likely it is that your development requirements truly don't overlap with ours.\nBut sometimes the answer is a clear \"yes\", in which case you'll simply need to consult another resource.\n",
